# Weather API Project

This repository contains the "Weather API" project, developed during my training period. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to fetch and display weather information based on a user-entered city name. The background of the application dynamically changes to reflect the weather conditions of the selected city.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to create an interactive web application that provides real-time weather updates. The project allowed me to work with APIs, learn JavaScript for data fetching and DOM manipulation, and apply dynamic styling with CSS based on weather conditions.

## Features

- **City-Based Weather Search**: Users can enter a city name to get the current weather information.
- **Dynamic Background**: The application's background changes according to the weather conditions of the entered city (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).
- **Weather API Integration**: Fetches live weather data from a third-party weather API.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**
